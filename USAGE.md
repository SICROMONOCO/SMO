# How to Use the TUI Dashboard

This application is composed of two main components that must be run separately:

1.  **The Agent (`agent.py`)**: A background script that collects system metrics.
2.  **The TUI Dashboard (`tui/tui_dashboard.py`)**: The user interface that displays the collected metrics.

The agent is responsible for gathering data and writing it to a log file (`logs/smo_metrics.jsonl`). The TUI Dashboard then reads from this log file to populate its widgets with live data.

## Running the Application

To see live data, you must have both components running at the same time. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Run the Agent

Open a terminal and run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
python3 agent.py
```

The agent will start collecting metrics and saving them to `logs/smo_metrics.jsonl`. You won't see any output in this terminal, as it's designed to run as a background process.

### Step 2: Run the TUI Dashboard

Open a **second terminal** and run the following command, also from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m tui.tui_dashboard
```

The `-m` flag is important, as it tells Python to run the TUI as a module, which allows it to handle relative imports correctly.

Once the TUI is running, it will automatically detect the log file being generated by the agent and begin displaying the live metrics in the "Live View" tab.
